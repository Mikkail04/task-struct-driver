# Accessing the Task Struct Using a Character Device Driver

This compilation of code extends a character device driver and accesses kernel data structures. 

---

## Features
- Extend a character device driver, implemented as a kernel module, to implement a new IOCTL
command in the driver. This new IOCTL command can be used to access a task_struct (task control
block) inside the Linux kernel.
- Extend a user space program to interact with the character device driver to test i
